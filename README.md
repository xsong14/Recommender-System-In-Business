# Recommender-System-In-Business
This is a recommender system project designed for a B2B E-commerce Company. The main tool I used for the project is Python.

For my internship in Revolution Dancewear during 06/2019 - 09/2019, I was trying to build a recommender system model for one of the onging
features on their E-commerce site. The goal was to find related products to a given product, so I implemented item-based collaborative 
filtering method based on KNN to find top K most similar items. The input data are preprocessed datasets with three columns which are Product ID,
Customer ID and Ratings. The outputs are recommendation lists saved as Excel files which include every product in the first column and four to nine
related products in the following columns.
